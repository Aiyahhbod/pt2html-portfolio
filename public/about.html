<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>
<p>Nice to meet you! I have a passion for coding and I recently obtained my certificate in web development and Python through Udemy and Code Acadamy. I would love to
  utilize these skills in a position where I can pursue my passion and start a new career! Here is a little about my background so you can get to know me: <br/>
  <br/>
  I'm a Libyan Canadian with 7 siblings, and I love spending time with my family. I enjoy cooking, making my own recipes, and learning about Libyan cuisine. I love the outdoors and being physically active, whether it be swimming, golfing, hiking, or weightlifting. When I want to relax, I also enjoy traveling and playing video games, especially Call of Duty and exploration games such as Subnautica.

  I would be happy to talk with you if you have any questions!</p>
